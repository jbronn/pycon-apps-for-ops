PyCon 2014: Apps for Ops
========================

This repository is meant to accompany my PyCon 2014 presentation: "Puppet Modules: Apps for Ops".

I have some additional thoughts in the [lecture notes](lecture_notes.md)

A working version of the [`pyapp`](pyapp/manifests/init.pp) is available here, you can test
it out with what's in the [`vagrant`](vagrant/README.md) directory.
